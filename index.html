	<li><strong>Provide Clarity and Transparency</strong>: One of the primary goals of the taxonomy is to provide clarity to investors, financial institutions, and companies about what activities are considered sustainable under Canadian standards. This clarity helps in promoting a shared understanding and facilitates informed decision-making in the investment community.</li>
	<li><strong>Support Canada&#39;s Climate Goals</strong>: The taxonomy is aligned with Canada&rsquo;s broader climate goals, including achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels. It is designed to ensure that the financial sector can contribute effectively to these national and global objectives.</li>

                approachtoeligibility: 'A general overview of how this classification process is articulated:<br />
<br />
<strong>Defined Categories:</strong>

<ul>
	<li>Green Activities: Defined as those with low or zero emissions throughout their lifecycle. They contribute directly to environmental objectives such as reducing carbon emissions or enhancing renewable energy capacity. Examples include renewable energy production (such as solar, wind, hydro), green building practices, and electric vehicle manufacturing.</li>
	<br />
	<li>Transition Activities: These include necessary transformations within high-emission sectors to lower-emission pathways. Crucial in sectors where immediate green alternatives are not viable but significant emissions reductions are achievable. Examples are the retrofitting of industrial equipment for improved efficiency or adopting lower-emission processes in manufacturing.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Classification Process:</strong>

<ul>
	<li>Eligibility Criteria: Activities are assessed against detailed eligibility criteria anchored in climate science, involving performance-based metrics and thresholds demonstrating alignment with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5&deg;C, consistent with the Paris Agreement.</li>
	<br />
	<li>Decision Trees:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>Initial steps involve identifying the sector (e.g., energy, transportation, industry) and specific activities within that sector.</li>
	<li>Activities are then evaluated against specific performance criteria, such as emission intensity, technology utilisation, and potential for emission reduction.</li>
	<li>The &quot;Do No Significant Harm&quot; (DNSH) criteria further assess activities to ensure they do not negatively impact other environmental or social objectives.</li>
	<li>Additional assessments may include scalability, economic viability, and compatibility with future technological and market developments.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li>Documentation and Verification: Activities qualifying under green or transition criteria must undergo documentation and third-party verification to ensure compliance with the taxonomy&rsquo;s standards. This process enhances credibility and transparency in the classification.</li>
	<br />
	<li>Review and Adaptation: The taxonomy undergoes periodic reviews to integrate the latest scientific research, technological advancements, and market changes, ensuring its continued relevance and effectiveness.</li>

<br />
The initial phase of taxonomy development indicates there will a focus on developing eligibility criteria for the following priority sectors:<br />
<br />
<strong>Electricity</strong>, which could include activities related to low- and zero-emitting electricity generation, electricity storage, and grid infrastructure improvements.<br />
<br />
<strong>Transportation</strong>, which could include low- and zero-emitting passenger and freight transportation activities in a variety of transportation modes (e.g., road, rail, marine transport) as well as enabling infrastructure (e.g., electric vehicle charging).<br />
<br />
<strong>Buildings</strong>, which could include the construction and operation of high-performance buildings, the retrofitting of buildings to improve their performance, and the installation of equipment to reduce the emissions of buildings and their occupants.<br />
<br />
<strong>Agriculture and Forestry</strong>, which could include the sustainable production of crops and livestock, activities to decarbonise agricultural production, and the planting, sustainable management, and restoration of forests.<br />
<br />
<strong>Heavy Industry</strong>:

<ul>
	<li>Manufacturing, which could include the low-emitting manufacture of materials and products such as cement and steel, the manufacture of low-carbon technologies such as renewable energy equipment, and activities to decarbonize industrial processes.</li>
	<li>Extractives, including mineral extraction and processing, and natural gas, which could include the sustainable extraction and processing of minerals needed for the net-zero transition as well as activities to decarbonize these processes. Eligibility criteria for activities to significantly decarbonize existing natural gas production could also be developed under this priority, provided they are consistent with the guiding principles. New natural gas production is not anticipated to be included.</li>

These important sectors of the Canadian economy have been prioritised based on the following criteria:
<ul>
	<li>Anticipated future levels of green and transition investment opportunity, including as assessed by market participants;</li>
	<li>Importance of their decarbonization for decarbonizing the Canadian economy, based on current sectoral emissions and projections of future emission reductions; and</li>
	<li>Economic significance to Canada, including current levels of investment and economic activity.</li>

                MemberofIPFS: 'Yes<br><br>Since joining the IPSF in December 2022, Australia has continued to take practical climate action and support its transition to a net zero economy. Australia is developing a Net Zero 2050 plan, as outlined in its 2022 Annual Climate Statement to Parliament and consistent with the recommendations of Australia’s Climate Change Authority (CCA). In 2022, we legislated Australias greenhouse gas emission targets to reach Net Zero by 2050, and 43% below 2005 levels by 2030. Australia has advanced the Government’s coordinated and ambitious sustainable finance agenda. In the 2023-24 Australian Budget, the Government laid the foundations for the Sustainable Finance Strategy by:<br>a) Committing to a sovereign green bonds program, with first issuance expected in mid- 2024<br>b) Enhancing Australia’s national corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission’s (ASIC) enforcement action on greenwashing<br>c) Co-funding with the private sector the initial phase of development for an Australian sustainable finance taxonomy. In 2023, the Australian Treasury released a draft Sustainable Finance Strategy for public consultation. The Strategy is consistent with the ongoing focus on climate risk and sustainable finance by Australia’s Council of Financial Regulators. In November 2022, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) published the outcomes of its first Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA), which focused on Australia’s major banks. The CVA provides insights into how climate change may test the resilience of the banking system, and how banks may manage risks. The Strategy will also build on the Australian Government’s commitment to introducing standardised, internationally aligned climate disclosure requirements for large, listed companies and financial institutions. The proposed disclosure regime will initially cover large companies and financial institutions and expand over time. It is proposed that first disclosures will commence as part of the 2024-25 financial reporting period. The Government is working closely with industry and the financial regulators to develop a framework which is aligned with the new global standards recently released by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). The Australian Government is co-funding the initial development of an Australian Sustainable Finance Taxonomy, in partnership with industry through the Australian Sustainable Finance Institute. The taxonomy aims to provide credible and consistent definitions for green and transition finance and help accelerate the allocation of capital towards sustainable activities to support Australia’s net-zero ambitions. The work commenced in July 2023 and is expected to run for the next 12-18 months. On greenwashing, the Australian Government is providing AUD 4.3 million to ASIC in 2023-24 to target misleading conduct in relation to sustainable finance. This involved enforcement of the existing law and does not impose new obligations. Costs will be recovered from industry under the ASIC Industry Funding Model. Australia’s commitment to introducing a Green Bond program will enable investors to back public projects driving Australia’s net zero transformation and boosting the scale and credibility of Australia’s green finance market. The first issuance of Sovereign Green Bonds will occur in mid-2024. The Australia-New Zealand 2+2 Climate and Finance Dialogue was first held in June 2023, and seeks to align sustainable finance frameworks and tools across the Tasman to enhance interoperability and support businesses operating across the economic region. The Australian Government is also exploring the role of social impact investing to support the delivery of community outcomes with a focus on addressing entrenched disadvantage. A co-design is underway to inform the establishment of a Commonwealth Outcomes Fund that will look to make payments to state and territory governments and service providers based on their delivery of agreed outcomes. Capability building initiatives have also been supported. This includes the Social Enterprise Development Initiative, which will provide grants and online education and mentoring to eligibleorganisations like social enterprises and charities to help them build their capability to access private capital and increase their ability to deliver improved social outcomes. Recognising the importance of frameworks that promote consistent global approaches, Australia has significantly elevated its international engagement on sustainable finance. This has included:<br>Strongly supporting international processes, including the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap, that promote alignment and interoperability on sustainable finance principles and priorities.<br>Strongly supporting the development of new global standards for climate and sustainability reporting through the ISSB, and the accelerated development of reporting frameworks and guidance for nature-related risks, impacts and dependencies, including the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).<br>Scaled-up global engagement by Australia’s financial regulators to support consistent global approaches to address greenwashing, promote transparency, and assess systematic financial risks.',

On adoption and application of green finance standards, following the introduction of the IPSF CGT as an identifier for green bonds under the Chinese Green Bond Principles (CGBP) last July, the Green Finance Committee of China Society for Finance and Banking has coordinated the relabelling of select outstanding green bonds traded on the China interbank market against the CGT. On July 14 2023, a list of 193 Chinese outstanding green bonds deemed aligned with the CGT was released. Since then, a renewed list of CGT-labelled green bonds is published on monthly basis. Based on the relabelled bonds, green bond funds were launched, and a green bond index was created to help investors track the market developments. In addition, Chinese issuers also used the CGT to label green bonds issued on international market. The relabelling work will remain a dynamic endeavour, and the list may expand as methodologies are refined and coverage widened according to the updated version of the IPSF Common Ground Taxonomy. On financial product innovation, the PBoC launched in 2021 two monetary policy instruments, the carbon emission reduction facility (CERF) and special central bank lending facility for green and efficient use of coal.

Enterprises from steel, power and other carbon-intensive industries were among the first to issue transition bonds in the inter-bank market in June 2022. By the end of August this year, Chinese issuers raised a total of 73.4 billion yuan through Sustainability-Linked Bonds (SLBs) and transition bonds in both domestic and foreign markets, 93% of which were SLBs and the rest were transition bonds. China’s green finance market continued its rapid growth. At end-June 2023, outstanding green loans reached 27 trillion yuan, and outstanding green bonds reached about 1.8 trillion yuan.

On regulatory policy, the CASG aims at developing a comprehensive Hong Kong roadmap on adopting the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Sustainability Disclosure Standards as appropriate, taking into account Hong Kong’s position on the global green finance map, local regulatory expectations and circumstances. As an initial move in this direction, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited consulted on enhanced climate-related reporting requirements for Hong Kong listed companies between April and July 2023. Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) requires all mandatory provident fund schemes to disclose their sustainable investing strategy and implementation progress in the schemes’ annual governance report for financial years ending on or after 30 November 2022. In May 2023, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released a discussion paper on “Prototype of a Green Classification Framework for Hong Kong” to outline the structure and core elements of a prototype framework of taxonomy and gathers feedback from stakeholders on its development and application. Since 2022, the Centre for Green and Sustainable Finance (GSF Centre) under the CASG has launched repositories to enhance talent and data resources for the financial industry. On capacity building, the GSF Centre has been assisting the Governments Capacity Building Support Scheme to provide subsidies for sustainable finance training, while CASG launched the Sustainable Finance Internship Initiative to create more internship opportunities. On data, the CASG launched, in December 2022 in collaboration with CDP, the Climate and Environmental Risk Questionnaire for Non-listed companies/small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) to assist SME with their sustainability reporting processes, and also to facilitate financial institutions’ collection and assessment of company-level data for risk assessment. Members of the CASG also continue to support Hong Kong’s position as a green and sustainable finance hub. For instance, the HKMA has supported the Government to issue close to USD 22 billion worth of green bonds, including the world’s first tokenised government green bond in February 2023; the Insurance Authority (IA) has been promoting Hong Kong as an insurance-linked securities (ILS) hub, with four ILS issuances in the form of catastrophe bonds totalling USD 562.5 million recorded as of March 2023; the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has authorised over 190 ESG funds with assets under management totalling USD 156 billion as of June 2023.

In late 2022, Presidential Regulation No. 112 outlined the gradual phase-out of coal-fired power plants, emphasising a shift towards renewable energy sources. Supporting this transition, the Minister of Finance (MOF) issued MOF Regulation No. 103 of 2023, establishing a framework to implement the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP). JETP aims to secure funding, including grants, loans, sovereign guarantees, and private investments, to decarbonise Indonesias energy sector transparently and effectively. Furthermore, over the past years, Indonesia has strived to advance the establishment of a regulatory framework for carbon pricing and trading with Presidential Regulation No. 98 of 2021, and Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MOEF) Regulation No. 21 of 2022. This year, Law No. 4 of 2023 was issued, governing, among other issues, the implementation of Indonesia’s domestic carbon market. Law 4/2023 provides that carbon trading through a carbon exchange is considered a financial transaction in the capital market sector, supervised by the Indonesian Financial Services Authority (OJK). In line with this mandate, OJK issued in August 2023 Regulation No. 14 of 2023 on Carbon Trading through Carbon Exchange (OJK 14/2023), further regulating the implementation of Indonesias carbon market. In May 2023, Indonesia issued the first publicly offered sovereign Blue Bond, raising ca. USD 150 million in the Japanese debt capital market. This issuance adheres to International Capital Market Association (ICMA) principles and aligns with the blue economy’s sustainable goals. The proceeds from this bond issuance support Indonesia’s blue economy, contributing to coastal protection, sustainable fisheries management, marine biodiversity conservation, and mangrove rehabilitation. In parallel, Indonesia’s Government has been developing a blue economy strategy aimed at improving the management of its marine and coastal ecosystems, creating equal economic opportunities and promoting sustainable livelihoods.',

It outlines key initiatives being discussed by the government to achieve JPY 150 trillion (approx. USD 1 trillion) of private-public investment to bring about Japan’s green transformation. It includes the government’s plan of JPY 20 trillion (approx. USD 144 billion) through issuing sovereign bonds as pump-priming to spur private investments. Sustainable finance is expected to contribute to the overall benefits of the economy and society by providing investments and loans that take various social and environmental issues into account, thereby having the effect of improving these issues. Regarding impact investment intended to create such environmental and social effects, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) established the ‘Working Group on Impact Investment’ to discuss measures to expand impact investment. Based on these discussions, the ‘Report by the Working Group on Impact Investment’ was compiled and announced in July 2023.4 The report summarised the basic significance and concept of impact investment and the direction of measures to promote impact investment from the perspective of promoting support for such companies and businesses and enhancing economic growth and sustainability through the resolution of social and environmental issues. Based on this report, a Consortium will be established by year-end of 2023, with public and private stakeholders in cooperation. In terms of the corporate disclosure enhancement, the FSA amended the regulations to introduce a new section for disclosure of sustainability information in the annual securities reports. The new section has been providing information related to sustainability issues, such as climate change and human capital in an integrated manner. The Amendment has been applied to annual securities reports for the fiscal year ending 31 March 2023 and thereafter.As sustainable finance is expanding around the world, the role of ESG evaluation and data providers is increasing. To enhance transparency and fairness of ESG evaluations and data providers, the FSA published ‘The Code of Conduct for ESG Evaluation and Data Providers’ (Code of Conduct) on 15 December 2022. The Code of Conduct is not laws or regulations that uniformly require actions of parties concerned but is designed to be a voluntary code on a ‘comply or explain’ basis. Based on the Code of Conduct, the FSA published the list of ESG Evaluation and Data Providers who have notified the FSA of their intention to endorse the Code of Conduct. In order to achieve 2050 carbon neutrality, it is essential to provide finance for the transition of hard- to-abate sectors which face technological or economic difficulties in decarbonising in one step. Some financial institutions may refrain from financing hard-to-abate sectors based on their concern of a temporary increase in financed emissions, which could result inhindering the transition of such sectors. With this problem awareness, FSA, METI, and MOE, in February 2023, jointly established the ‘Japan Public and Private Working Group on Financed Emissions to Promote Transition Finance’ (working group). The working group examined and discussed possible solutions to the challenges above and compiled discussion results into a paper titled ‘Addressing the Challenges of Financed Emissions.',

To date, Malaysias forest cover stands at 54.6%, or 18.04 million hectares, of its total land area. In preserving nature’s biodiversity and forest management, the Malaysian Government has increased the Ecological Fiscal Transfer for Biodiversity Conservation (EFT) allocation to State Governments to USD 31.99 million per year compared to USD 14.93 million in 2022. The Malaysian Government has also allocated USD 8.11 million8 to protect wildlife along with their forest habitats. In addition, Malaysia is currently working towards fulfilling its shared global responsibilities for biodiversity conservation with the adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). This includes translating Kunming-Montreal GBF into the national plans and policies. Efforts are currently taking place to revise Malaysia’s National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans to be consistent with Kunming-Montreal GBF. The recent Federal Budget 2024 announced that the Malaysian government will pioneer the issuance of a biodiversity sukuk of up to USD 214.11 million to fund, among others, replantation efforts of degraded forests that will in turn generate carbon credits. The Securities Commission (SC) Malaysia continues to develop a robust SRI ecosystem as guided by the respective roadmap and masterplans for the Malaysian capital market. As sustainable investments continue to grow, a more systematic classification system is also needed to facilitate comparability of economic activities and alignment with environmental, social and sustainability goals. The SC issued the Principles-based SRI Taxonomy (SRI Taxonomy) in December 2022 to achieve this. The SRI Taxonomy is principles-based and aims to enable capital market participants to identify economic activities that are aligned with environment, social and sustainability objectives, thus facilitating a more informed and efficient decision-making for fundraising and investment for sustainability. The SRI Taxonomy outlines four environmental objectives, namely climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, protection of healthy ecosystem and biodiversity, and the promotion of resource resilience and transition to circular economy. As the SRI Taxonomy is principles-based, it may be applied at the project, asset, entity or portfolio level and it can also be applied alongside the various SRI product frameworks issued by the SC. In 2023, the SRI Taxonomy has been applied for the issuance of an SRI Sukuk in Malaysia, of which the proceed was used to finance renewable energy projects. Other eligible green SRI projects under the SRI Sukuk Framework include energy efficiency, climate change adaptation, biodiversity conservation and clean transportation. In response to the development of a Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM), Bursa Malaysia launched Bursa Carbon Exchange (BCX), in December 2022, as part of the nation’s commitment towards achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions. The VCM can assist nature-based projects that can enhance the natural ecosystems and improve biodiversity to be carried out. BCX has successfully carried out Malaysia’s inaugural carbon credit auction in March 2023, that saw encouraging participation with 15 buyers from various industries purchasing a total of 150,000 Verra-registered carbon credits. The SC, as co-chair of the Joint Committee on Climate Change (JC3), is also continuing its role in pursuing collaborative actions for building climate resilience within the Malaysian financial sector. JC3, formed in 2019 by the SC and Bank Negara Malaysia, is also leading a series of engagements between climate experts, advocates, innovators, practitioners, policymakers, and regulators to discuss on the opportunities and challenges for the practical application of sustainable finance.

                MemberofIPFS: 'Yes<br><br>Singapore is firmly committed to global efforts on the transition to a net zero economy. In October 2022, Singapore announced it would raise its climate target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Singapore would also reduce emissions to around 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030 after peaking emissions earlier. Singapore is well-placed to be a leading centre for green and sustainable finance to support Asia’s net zero transition. In April 2023, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched its Finance for Net Zero (FiNZ) Action Plan which expands its focus to include transition finance. This builds on the Green Finance Action Plan introduced in 2019 to mobilise financing to catalyse Asia’s net zero transition and decarbonise the entire economy, including hard-to-abate sectors. On data, definitions, and disclosures, MAS has launched the Singapore-Asia taxonomy for climate change mitigation, following four rounds of public consultation, to align definitions of green and transition activities, including criteria for credibly financing early phase-out of coal-fired power plants. MAS has also proposed a code of conduct for ESG ratings and data product providers. The Singapore Exchange (SGX) and the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) have consulted on a roadmap for mandatory climate-related disclosures referencing the ISSB standards for all Singapore-listed issuers and large non-listed companies. To accelerate transition financing activities, MAS expanded the Sustainable Bond and Loan Grant Schemes to include transition bonds and loans, beyond green, social, sustainable, and sustainability- linked ones. The schemes defray external review and reporting costs for issuers and borrowers. To promote greater transparency in the sustainable debt market, MAS enhanced the schemes by providing a higher grant cap to incentivise issuers and borrowers early adoption of entity-level sustainability disclosures that are aligned with international disclosure frameworks and standards. To spur adoption of ESG technology solutions, MAS launched an ESG FinTech grant for Singapore-based financial institutions. MAS, SGX, ACRA and partners will support disclosures by SMEs in the years ahead. This involves scaling Project Greenprint’s disclosure portal ESGenome into a disclosure utility capable of meeting national-level reporting needs (including SME sustainability reporting), defining baseline metrics to streamline SME reporting, and coordinating SME training initiatives to encourage adoption. In June 2023, MAS, SGX, and the Climate Data Steering Committee signed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish interoperability between Greenprint and the Net Zero Data Public Utility (NZDPU). This will support the consent-based flow of reporting entities’ greenhouse gas emissions data, net zero targets, and carbon offsets usage, towards a joint vision of transparent and comparable net zero data. To forge a climate resilient financial sector, MAS has made progress in integrating environmental risk into its supervisory framework and processes at both the individual firm and system-wide levels. MAS will continue its efforts to (i) uplift environmental risk management practices of financial institutions through ongoing supervision and industry engagement, (ii) deepen climate risk assessment capabilities through climate scenario analysis, and (iii) enhance climate-related disclosure standards to promote market transparency. MAS has published a consultation paper on supervisory guidance to financial institutions about having a sound transition planning process that supports credible decarbonisation efforts of their clients. The guidance on transition planning covers financial institutions’ governance frameworks and client engagement processes to manage climate-related financial risks and support transition in the real economy.',

In the updated NDC, Sri Lanka commits to increase its forest coverage to 32% by 2030 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 14.5% for the period of 2021 to 2030 from power, transport, industry, waste, forestry, and agriculture. Sri Lanka has advanced its objective of achieving Carbon Neutrality from 2060 to 2050, with no capacity addition of coal power and 70% renewable energy by 2030 in electricity generation. Based on the Sustainable Finance Roadmap, which was launched in 2019 with the engagement of financial sector stakeholders, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) released the Sri Lanka Green Finance Taxonomy in May 2022 which is used for defining and categorising economic activities that can be considered environmentally sustainable. The taxonomy was supported by the International Finance Co-operation (IFC) both technically and financially through the Sustainable Banking and Finance Network (SBFN) and is based on the IPSF’s Common Ground Taxonomy exercise between the EU and Chinese taxonomies. Subsequent to releasing the taxonomy, CBSL issued a Direction for the licensed banks in respect of sustainable finance activities they carry out and a similar guideline was issued for the Licensed Finance Companies to categorise green loans as specified in the taxonomy. As identified in the Roadmap, capacity building for the stakeholders is a key priority for the development of sustainable finance in the country. CBSL organised multiple programmes on climate change and sustainable finance with the co-operation of international agencies during the year, especially for the participants from the financial institutions and financial sector regulators. The training programmes were well utilised by the financial sector and provided an indication of the level of enthusiasm for greening the economy. In July this year, Sri Lanka, represented by CBSL, joined the IPSF as the twentieth member of the platform and expects to use this opportunity for developing capacity in the area and to learn from the knowledge shared by the member jurisdictions in multiple discussion forums. CBSL in August 2023 appointed a five-member panel of experts who have hands-on experience in relevant industrial sectors and have been instrumental in the development of the taxonomy to assist the financial sector participants in understanding the technicalities in the taxonomy. Further, the National Financial Inclusion Strategy was unveiled in 2022 which has a dedicated pillar to assist the formal financial sector to scale up MSME lending and expand the range of high-quality products, with a specific focus on green and sustainable finance, complementing the Sustainable Finance Roadmap.',
